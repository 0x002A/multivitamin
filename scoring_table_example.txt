# !Warning!: the following pairs have not been assigned in the scoring table. Assuming 0: 
# C   Cl    0
# etc.
# If you want to forbid the mapping of a specific pair, change the check_semantics() function in custom.py accordingly. 
# that way, users can run the program once and get all the pairs, so they can copy them
